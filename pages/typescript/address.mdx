# Address Object

`Address` could be represented in multiple forms: friendly and raw. Friendly one can have different flags set: `bounceable` and `testOnly`.
In general you should always have `bounceable` flag set and `testOnly` is set depending on if you are working with production or test network.

Library always strips out this flags and doesn't store them internally, this flags are always provided/resolved only during parsing or serialization.

## Fields
* `workChain` - address' worchain - `0` or `-1`
* `hash` - address' hash - `32 byte buffer`

## Parsing friendly address
You should always use this parser when processing input from a user.

```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const friendlyParsed = Address.parseFriendly('kQAs9VlT6S776tq3unJcP5Ogsj-ELLunLXuOb1EKcOQi47nL');
console.log(friendly.isBounceable); // false
console.log(friendly.isTestOnly); // true
console.log(friendly.address); // Address itself
```

## Parsing RAW address
```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const address = Address.parseRaw(Buffer.from('2cf55953e92efbeadab7ba725c3f93a0b23f842cbba72d7b8e6f510a70e422e3', 'hex'));
console.log(address.toFriendly()); // Address itself
```

## Parsing RAW or Friendly address
This is a helper method that is useful for tests. This parser always ignore `bounceable` and `testOnly` flags;
```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const address = Address.parse('kQAs9VlT6S776tq3unJcP5Ogsj-ELLunLXuOb1EKcOQi47nL');
console.log(address.toFriendly()); // Address itself
```

## Address to friendly string

```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const address = Address.parse('kQAs9VlT6S776tq3unJcP5Ogsj-ELLunLXuOb1EKcOQi47nL');
console.log(address.toFriendly()); // Bounceable production address
console.log(address.toFriendly({ testOnly: true })); // Bounceable test address
console.log(address.toFriendly({ bounceable: true })); // Non-Bounceable production address
```

## Address to RAW string
```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const address = Address.parse('kQAs9VlT6S776tq3unJcP5Ogsj-ELLunLXuOb1EKcOQi47nL');
console.log(address.toString()); // RAW representation of an address
```

## Test equality
Regardles of how you parse address you can always compare address to each other:
```js
import { Address } from 'ton';
const address1 = Address.parseFriendly('kQAs9VlT6S776tq3unJcP5Ogsj-ELLunLXuOb1EKcOQi47nL').address;
const address2 = Address.parseRaw(Buffer.from('2cf55953e92efbeadab7ba725c3f93a0b23f842cbba72d7b8e6f510a70e422e3', 'hex'));
console.log(address1.equals(address2)); // true
```
