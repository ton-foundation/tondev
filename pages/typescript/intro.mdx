# `ton` - library for Web, Node and React Native

Popular library for TON written in Typescript, well tested and used in production in
a lot of projects.

### Install

```bash
yarn add ton buffer
```

For browsers `Buffer` is needed:

```js
// Add before using library
require("buffer");
```

## Usage

To connect to blockchain you need HTTP API endpoint, you can use one of the public endpoints

```js
import { TonClient } from "ton";

// Create Client
const client = new TonClient({
  endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
});

// Open Wallet
const wallet = await client.openWallet('<public-key>');
console.log(wallet.address);
console.log(await wallet.getBalance());

// Transfering coins
let seqno = await wallet.getSeqNo();

// In case of failure you can safely retry calling this method
await wallet.transfer({ to: 'some-address', amount: 10.0, seqno, secretKey: '<secret>' });
```
